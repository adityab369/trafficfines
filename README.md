<b>Problem Statement:

In this Problem, you have to write an application in JAVA that keeps track of traffic fines.
All violations are noted by a traffic policeman in a file as a record <license number of driver, fine
amount>. At the end of each day, files from all traffic policemen are collated. If a driver had been
charged with more than three violations so far, then he has to be booked for further legal action.
Also, the police department provides additional bonus to those policemen who have brought in
large fine earnings. All policemen who have collected more than 90% of the maximum fine amount
collected by any individual so far, shall be awarded the bonus.
1. Find out the drivers who are booked for legal action: All such license numbers are to be
output in a file called “violators.txt”.
2. Find out the policemen who are eligible for bonus: The list of policemen eligible for bonus
must be output in a file called “bonus.txt”.
